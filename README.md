# Python-YouTube-MP3-Downloader
Downloads videos as MP3 from YouTube

This is another one of my random ideas which I thought would be cool,
I decided to make a YouTube to MP3, you would primarily use it for downloading songs.
It has the ability to download single songs or songs bulk.

Modules required:
  
  * Tkinter
  * YoutubeDL

How to use:

Simply run MP3Downloader.py and copy the link of the video you would like to download.
Or you can paste a number of links into a text file (each line should be a single link).
